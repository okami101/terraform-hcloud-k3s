# Terraform Hetzner Cloud K3S

## üéØ About

Get a cheap HA-ready Kubernetes cluster in less than **5 minutes**, with easy configuration setup through simple Terraform variables, üíØ GitOps compatible !

This opinionated Terraform template will generate a ready-to-go cloud infrastructure through Hetzner Cloud provider, with preinstalled [K3S](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s), the most popular lightweight Kubernetes distribution.

Additional controllers and workers can be easily added thanks to terraform variables, even after initial setup for **easy upscaling**. Feel free to fork this project in order to adapt for your custom needs.

Check [Kube-Hetzner](https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner) for a more advanced setup with Hetzner Cloud with optimized OS for containers workload. This project uses only OS supported by Hetzner and intends to be far more lightweight without any local/remote exec provisioners (only cloud-init), quicker to set up, and Windows compatible.

### Networking and firewall

All nodes including LB will be linked with a proper private network as well as **solid firewall protection**. For admin management, only the 1st main control plane (bastion) node will have open ports for SSH (configurable) and kube-apiserver (port **6443**), with **IP whitelist** support. Other internal nodes will be accessed by SSH Jump.

Hetzner Load Balancer will be used for any external public access to your cluster.

### OS management

This Terraform template includes **[Salt Project](https://docs.saltproject.io)** as well for easy global OS management of the cluster through ssh, perfect for upgrades in one single time !

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before starting, you need to have :

1. A Hetzner cloud account.
2. A `terraform` client.
3. A `hcloud` client.
4. A `kubectl` client.

On Windows :

```powershell
scoop install terraform hcloud
```

## üèÅ Starting

### Prepare

The first thing to do is to prepare a new hcloud project :

1. Create a new **EMPTY** hcloud empty project.
2. Generate a **Read/Write API token key** to this new project according to [this official doc](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/).

### Setup

Now it's time for initial cluster setup.

1. Copy [this kube config example](kube.tf.example) into a new empty directory and rename it `kube.tf`.
2. Execute `terraform init` in order to install the required module
3. Replace all variables according your own needs.
4. Finally, use `terraform apply` to check the plan and initiate the cluster setup.

## Usage

### Access

Once terraform installation is complete, terraform will output the SSH config necessary to connect to your cluster for each node as well as following public IPs :

| Variable         | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bastion_ip`     | Bastion IP for OS and Kubernetes management             |
| `controller_ips` | All available IPs controllers for Kubernetes API access |
| `lb_ip`          | Load Balancer IP to use for any external public access  |
| `lb_id`          | Load Balancer ID to use for attaching any services      |

Copy the SSH config to your own SSH config, default to `~/.ssh/config`. After few minutes, you can use `ssh <cluster_name>` in order to log in to your main control plane node. For other nodes, the control plane will be used as a bastion for direct access to other nodes, so use `ssh <cluster_name>-worker-01` to directly access to your *worker-01* node.

### Salt

Once logged to your bastion, don't forget to active *Salt*, just type `sudo salt-key -A` in order to accept all discovered minions. You are now ready to use any `salt` commands for global OS management, as `sudo salt '*' pkg.upgrade` for global OS upgrade in one single time.

> If salt-key command is not existing, wait few minutes as it's necessary that cloud-init has finished his job.

### Kubernetes

#### Check K3S status

When logged, use `sudo kubectl get nodes -o wide` to check node status and be sure all nodes is ready and have proper private IPs. Then use `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to get the kubeconfig file and use it with your local kubectl (default to `~/.kube/config`). Adapt the IP accordingly to any valid public controllers IP.

You should now be able to use `kubectl` commands remotely to manage your cluster and ready-to-go to do some deployments !

#### Upscaling and downscaling

You can easily add or remove nodes by changing the `count` variable of each pool or control plane. Then use `terraform apply` to apply the changes.

* When adding, the K3S server or agent will be automatically added to the cluster and ready to use. Don't forget to accept the new minion with `sudo salt-key -A`.
* When removing, you should manually drain and delete node before removing the node with `sudo kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets <cluster_name>-<pool>-<count>` and `sudo kubectl delete nodes <cluster_name>-<pool>-<count>`. Then use `terraform apply` to delete the node physically.
